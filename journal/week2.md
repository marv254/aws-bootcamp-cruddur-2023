# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

For week 2 coverage i was able to use different tools for distributed tracing and observability:

**1. HoneyComb**

**Instrumente backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider**

First you add the dependencies  below to your ```requirements.txt ```
```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```
then you install these dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

In our app.py we will then instrument it to use OTEL with HoneyComb.io as the provider

for it to work with our docker compose file we will have to set env vars to our backend container
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"
```
You also have to set API key as environment variable:
```
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
```
