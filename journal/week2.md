# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

For week 2 coverage i was able to use different tools for distributed tracing and observability:

**1. HoneyComb**

**i). Instrumente backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider**

First you add the dependencies  below to your ```requirements.txt ```
```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```
then you install these dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

In our app.py we will then instrument it to use OTEL with HoneyComb.io as the provider

for it to work with our docker compose file we will have to set env vars to our backend container
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"
```
You also have to set API key as environment variable:
```
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
```

**ii). Run queries to explore traces within HoneyComb.io**

We already set our cruddur app to automatically send data to our honeycomb account.

we then run a query to group our data by traceid

**2. AWS X-Ray**

**Instrument AWS X-Ray for backend flask**

First we weill set our env vars 
```
export AWS_REGION="ca-central-1"
gp env AWS_REGION="ca-central-1"
```
add dependencies in ```requirements.txt``` 
```
aws-xray-sdk
```
we will then install these dependencies by issuing  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

In our ```app.py``` file we will add the code below to instrument AWS X-Ray

```
from aws_xray_sdk.core import xray_recorder
from aws_xray_sdk.ext.flask.middleware import XRayMiddleware

xray_url = os.getenv("AWS_XRAY_URL")
xray_recorder.configure(service='Cruddur', dynamic_naming=xray_url)
XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder)
```
Setting up  AWS X-Ray Resources

Add ```aws/json/xray.json```
```
{
  "SamplingRule": {
      "RuleName": "Cruddur",
      "ResourceARN": "*",
      "Priority": 9000,
      "FixedRate": 0.1,
      "ReservoirSize": 5,
      "ServiceName": "backend-flask",
      "ServiceType": "*",
      "Host": "*",
      "HTTPMethod": "*",
      "URLPath": "*",
      "Version": 1
  }
}
```

we will then create a log group by issuing the commands below:
```
FLASK_ADDRESS="https://4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}"
aws xray create-group \
   --group-name "Cruddur" \
   --filter-expression "service(\"backend-flask")
   ```
we will then use the x-ray.json file that we created earlier to create our sampling rule for x-ray
```
aws xray create-sampling-rule --cli-input-json file://aws/json/xray.json
```
we will also need to add a x-ray daemon service in our docker-compose fiel

```
  xray-daemon:
    image: "amazon/aws-xray-daemon"
    environment:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}"
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"
      AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"
    command:
      - "xray -o -b xray-daemon:2000"
    ports:
      - 2000:2000/udp
```
Finally we will set two env vars to our backend-flask in our docker-compose.yml file
```
      AWS_XRAY_URL: "*4567-${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID}.${GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CLUSTER_HOST}*"
      AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: "xray-daemon:2000"
```
