# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
From the security consideration topic i learned how to implement MFA on root and IAM users, i also learned its good practice not to create any workloads with the root user so I created an admin user(devopsmarv) account and give it admin priviledges.

I also learned how to create roles and assign them to users, for example in my case i created a role that would give full ec2 permissions to a user by attaching a custom policy.

From the architectural design i learned how to design conceptual and logical design using Lucid Charts

From the billing topic, I learned how to create budgets so that when i exceed a certain threshold on my aws spending i get notified via email. This helps you in tracking your costs.
